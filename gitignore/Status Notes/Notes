1️⃣ login.html

Styled simply, matching the Story Studio theme.

Form has name="username" and name="password" so Express can read req.body.

Form uses method="POST" and action="/login".

Login button is type="submit".

Looks like a news card / clean page instead of just a bare form.

2️⃣ signup.html

Same style as login page.

Form posts to /signup.

Inputs have name attributes.

Clean page, fits the Story Studio theme.
